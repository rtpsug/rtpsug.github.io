## Meeting Description:

In this presentation, we will explore the powerful capabilities of the PowerShell Application Deployment Toolkit (PSADT) and how it can enhance your application deployment processes. We will begin with a basic introduction to PSADT, understanding its purpose and significance. Then, we'll dive into practical aspects, such as adding extensions, exploring the ApDeployToolkitMain.ps1 script, and utilizing toolkit functions without running deploy-application.ps1 separately.
We will also explore custom extension functions, like managing WIM files and handling user presentations, along with using token replacement to automate custom logic in deploy-application.ps1.
