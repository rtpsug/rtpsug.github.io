üåü Calling all coders! üñ•Ô∏è Join us for a fun community event where you can show off your PowerShell coding skills in quick 5-10 minute demos. Whether you're a newbie or a pro, everyone is welcome to share their tools and scripts.

## Meeting Overview:

Join us for an exciting community event where members can showcase their own code through short 5-10 minute demos.

- Have you recently solved a work-related problem that you think could benefit others?
- Are you facing a coding challenge that you're struggling to overcome?
- Found a great article online?

Feel free to showcase anything interesting that saves you time or makes your job easier or let the community assist you in solving your problem!

## What can you share?

Any code that you believe may be useful to others is welcome. It could be a simple two-line script or a complex function. The purpose of community sharing is to expose code to others so that they can benefit from your work.

We accommodate all skill levels, so don't hesitate to demonstrate a script that you found helpful. No need for slides or fancy presentations‚Äîjust share your code and explain what it does. Each participant will have approximately five minutes to present.
