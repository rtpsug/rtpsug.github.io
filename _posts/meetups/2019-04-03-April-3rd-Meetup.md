## Enterprise Reporting & Notifications with PowerShell

Learn the possibilities of creating eye-catching reports and sending data to other mediums other than just HTML and email! Join us April 3rd at 8:30 pm and learn some tricks for manipulating and reporting on data in your environment!

Our guest speaker for this meeting is Bradley Wyatt, who is a sysadmin located in the Chicago area. Bradley works in a fast moving environment and has his hands into all aspects of his org's computer environment: from cloud to clients. In his spare time, Bradley is an avid blogger and has lots of great content his site https://www.thelazyadministrator.com/ that you can read and use immediately.

Bradley has worked extensively on using PowerShell to create meaningful alerts and reports that have a ton of value and pop! He has produced a small arsenal of tools for sending data to Teams in real time as well as creating dashboards and reports that pull data from various Microsoft cloud products like Office365, Intune and others. Simply put, Bradley has an eye for making attractive reports that are different than what you might have seen in the past.

This is a live streamed event that will also be recorded and posted on YouTube afterward. By attending this meeting, you agree to allow us to use any recordings of yourself for later use and to be posted in public forums such as YouTube and Reddit.
