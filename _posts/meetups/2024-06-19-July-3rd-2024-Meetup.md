Join us this month for twice the PowerShell learning with demos by Mike Kanakos and Phil Bossman.

<!--more-->

## Meeting Overview:

Get ready for double the fun this month with two featured PowerShell Skill builder sessions! You get twice the amount of PowerShell goodness to enjoy!

**Mike Kanakos** will share how he handled a basic task: identifying the individual linked to each of 750 computers. Spoiler: Active Directory did not contain the owner information. Weâ€™ll walk through how Mike figured out how to find the info, make a working query and eventually format the requested output.

Discover how **Phil Bossman** achieves exceptional speed in his code by leveraging parallel actions. Philâ€™s desire was to upgrade his function, which accepted pipeline input and processed it sequentially, into a high-speed tool that used parallel processing to breeze through the task! Phil will share how he updated the function and the code that allowed him to get a tremendous performance boost!
