Ever needed to perform the same work against multiple instances of SQL Server?

<!--more-->

## Meeting Overview:

 How could multiple instances have their error logs searched using multithreaded approaches? What are the considerations for organizing multiple results or troubleshooting errors from some of the targeted instances? In this session specific approaches will be demonstrated and scripts provided that you can add to your DBA toolbox.

## Speaker Info:

### Lars Rasmussen

Lars Rasmussen started tinkering with Apple II computers in 5th grade. At 19 a fellow construction worker co-signed on a loan for Lars' very own 486 DX2 - running at a then blazing 50MHz. He parlayed his tech savvy into a support position at WordPerfect in 1994 thanks to the help of a good friend, and created his first live web page on novell.com using notepad & Paint Shop Pro in 1995. Lars is employed as a database administrator for Henry Schein.
