Get ready to dive into the world of data formatting for all your reports and outputs, alongside your fellow RTPSUG group members!

We're excited to kick off our new series: **"PowerShell Skill Builders!"**

<!--more-->

The concept behind this series is simple - we're here to tackle everyday problems as a group. And guess what? There's more than one way to solve these challenges!

Many of you will have your own tricks up your sleeves, and the paths you take to find the answers can be quite diverse. By peeking into the methods your teammates use, we can all pick up some fresh problem-solving skills. So, get ready to learn together and have some fun while you're at it!

## Meeting Description:

This month, we're diving into two familiar scenarios: crafting user reports from Active Directory and extracting data from Event Logs.

For each of these challenges, we're inviting you to come up with various outputs to solve the simple problems we will give you. There's no one-size-fits-all solution. We encourage everyone to tackle these problems in your own distinctive style.

We're all about collaboration and learning from each other, so when you've reached that solution, don't hold back! Share your journey with us, and together, we can explore the diverse methods used to solve these puzzles.

We'll start out by showing how we arrived at the solution and then we'll ask community members to share how they solved the challenge. If you're just starting out, don't worry; these challenges won't be too tough â€“ they're actually quite manageable. The primary goal here is to see the various paths people take to arrive at the same outcome.

We will post two data sets on Tuesday evening. You can download the data sets and the problem descriptions that we want you to solve. Then you work on them ahead of time if you like and we can collaborate when we meet on Wednesday, compare solutions and offer alternatives we didn't consider.
