David Stein will be joining us this month to discuss how code and more specifically, PowerShell has become a tool he uses to to help meet customers demands and solve problems. He will be sharing with us specific examples of how PowerShell was able to find very specific data that customers wanted to find but did not have the tools or knowledge on how to get answers they need.
