Jake Hildreth will join us to show how he used Crescendo to turn those clunky **CertUtil.exe** commands into smooth, PowerShell-friendly tools you’ll actually enjoy using.

<!--more-->

## Meeting Overview:

Over the years, many Microsoft command-line tools have come and gone, but some, like certutil.exe, have stood the test of time. Chances are you’ve used certutil countless times for certificate tasks 🔐, and maybe even memorized some of its old-school syntax to get things done. But one thing is clear: CertUtil doesn’t exactly play well with PowerShell or automation out of the box.

If you’re ready to change that, join us to see how Jake Hildreth leveraged Crescendo to transform CertUtil’s raw, unstructured output into a clean, PowerShell-friendly tool that you’ll actually enjoy using in your scripts ⚙️.

Jake will introduce Crescendo and explain the challenges it addresses. Then he’ll guide us through the journey from traditional CertUtil commands to their improved, Crescendo-powered versions. Along the way, he’ll share some bumps he encountered (and how he solved them), because every good demo includes a bit of troubleshooting! 🛠️

Whether you’re a PowerShell expert or just looking to simplify CertUtil, this session has something for you. Bring your questions and curiosity — let’s make CertUtil fun again! 🚀
