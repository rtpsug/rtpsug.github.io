Pester is a test framework for PowerShell. It allows you to define all kinds of test cases and report the results. Using this framework, you can build tests to automatically test every piece of code before it is released to production environments. The tests are limited mostly by your imagination!

## "Pester: Why You Should -Be Using Pester"

Come join us on April 17th at the Metlife campus at 6:30 pm in Cary to hear how this month's speaker, Jonathan Moss, cut his teeth using Pester at his company. Jonathan will be walking us through why you should be using Pester and how to get started doing so.

Jonathan is a sysadmin in the RTP area and has recently started to incorporate Pester into his daily work routines. His team has invested heavily in PowerShell and automation overall. He'll be sharing real-world examples of what worked and what didn't in his beginnings with Pester.

This is a local meeting that will be held at the Metlife campus in Cary but we'll also have a virtual meeting/livestream option for people who cannot attend in person. The meeting starts at 6:30 pm and the presentation will begin at 7 pm. The first half hour is for members to socialize, eat and cover any announcements that are related to the group. The live-stream link for this meeting will be posted the day of the meeting to people who have RSVP'ed yes to this event.

REMINDER FOR LOCAL ATTENDEES: You must bring identification with you!!! MetLife security will not allow anyone to enter the facility without ID.

This event will be recorded and posted on YouTube afterward. By attending this meeting, you allow us to any recordings of yourself for later use and to be posted in public forums such as YouTune and Reddit.
