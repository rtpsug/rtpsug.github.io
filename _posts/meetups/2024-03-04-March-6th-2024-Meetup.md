## Meeting Overview:

Is Linux one of the operating systems you must use and support? (Azure Cloud Shell, anyone?) Or maybe you want to learn Linux. PowerShell can help you transition from being a thriving Windows Administrator to surviving in an organization that has zero Windows Servers. Discover the important distinctions between PowerShell usage on Linux and Windows. Learn the top skills needed to excel in Linux. Learn how to use your knowledge of PowerShell for working with Bash or any scripting language.
