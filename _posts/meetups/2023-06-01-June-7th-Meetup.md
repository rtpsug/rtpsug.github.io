## Meeting Description

These days it's becoming more common for sysadmins and all computer pros to work with API's. What are API's? API stands for application programming interface, which is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software.

API's used to be the domain of software dev's. But now, API's are used by everyone. That means that you, the IT Pro, are expected to know how to interact with an API to get send and receive data securely over the web.

Join Devin Rich as he takes you on a hands-on, guided tour of working with APIs in PowerShell. You will learn about and practice reading documentation, authenticating, and transmitting/receiving/manipulating data with APIs.

This session is equally geared for PowerShell novices who have never worked with the PowerShell WebCmdlets as well as the veteran who helps architect APIs.

## Speaker Bio

Devin Rich is an 10 year IT pro who specializes in automation, networking, and security in the financial services sector. He got his start in IT as a 15-yr old at his high school where he ran/terminated Ethernet cables and administered the school WiFi.
