Join Josh Hendricks for a look at how build functional AND beautiful documentation from your existing code with PlatyPS.

## Meeting Overview:

As an IT pro, you get that having top-notch documentation for your tools is key. But letâ€™s be real. Sometimes docs end up on the back burner or get skipped altogether. But hey, the good news is, building and sharing beautiful, functional documentation has never been easier.

Josh Hendricks will show how to generate documentation with PlatyPS and develop a user-friendly website for easy access to the documentation. Join us for this interactive workshop where we will enhance a basic PowerShell project by creating visually appealing, responsive, and searchable online documentation. Donâ€™t forget to bring your laptop to take part in this hands-on demo!
