This presentation will primarily showcase usage of the PowerShell module TrackGpo, how it can tie in to Git repos, and how to extend its functionality. [TrackGPO](https://gitlab.com/devirich/trackgpo) is a PowerShell module that allows you to track changes to Group Policy Objects (GPOs) easily.

Join Devin as he talks about challenges that he faced while turning group policy into a predictable and usable set of data!
