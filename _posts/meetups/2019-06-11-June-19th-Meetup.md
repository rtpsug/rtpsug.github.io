This meeting is about community and our awesome members! We're opening the floor to our membership to share knowledge first-hand with one another.

<!--more-->

We'll be doing rapid fire code demos that are no more than 10 minutes in length. You're invited to share a script you have written, a tool you found or problem you solved through PowerShell. It doesn't have to be your script. If you use it, feel free to talk about it!

Share your code snippets with the group and show how you use PowerShell to solve problems, improve processes, or even delegate more work to others. We'll all be sharing small chunks of code that help us get tasks done! Share something you use with the group and discuss it briefly. You only need to fill about 5 minutes worth of time. No slides needed! You don't need to be an expert, you only need to have a desire to share something that interested you!

Our community is a mix of beginners all the way through experts. We welcome all who like to share, regardless of skill level. Everyone has something to share no matter what your experience or skill level is. Come join us and see how our community of scripters and problem solvers work together to share knowledge among our peers!

If your intention is to share some content, please reach out to Mike Kanakos or Phil Bossman ahead of time, so we can plan accordingly. We can be reached at mkanakos@gmail.com or pbossman@gmail.com or on twitter at @mikeKanakos or @schluage. Also you find us on PowerShell slack.

This is a local meeting that will be held at the Metlife campus in Cary but we'll also have a virtual meeting/live stream option for people who cannot attend in person. The meeting starts at 6:30 pm and the presentation will begin at 7 pm. The first half hour is for members to socialize, eat and cover any announcements that are related to the group.
