Learn PowerShell security fundamentals and best practices to safeguard your scripting environment.

<!--more-->

## Meeting Description:

We all love writing PowerShell code to solve different challenges and make our tasks easier. However, it is equally important to establish a secure environment for PowerShell scripting in order to protect sensitive information and prevent unauthorized access.

Join [James Petty](https://twitter.com/PSJamesP) as he provides a comprehensive overview of the security features of PowerShell! We will explore the capabilities of execution policies and demonstrate how they can regulate script execution and mitigate potential risks. 

Additionally, we will delve into the security aspects of PowerShell remoting, emphasizing the significance of secure communication channels when managing remote systems.

Last but not least, we will also discuss PowerShell module security, focusing on the best practices for managing and securing PowerShell modules within your environment.
