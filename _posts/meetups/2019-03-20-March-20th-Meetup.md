## Automating AD Health Checks

Most admins don’t have the time to keep an eye on every part of their IT infrastructure, let alone every nook and cranny of Active Directory.<!--more-->

This month we'll discuss how to create automated jobs to regularly check the core services and functions of AD and alert you in real time using nothing more than PS Scripts, email and other off the shelf tools.

Our speaker for this session is Mike Kanakos, who is a senior sysadmin & AD engineer for Lord Corporation in Cary, NC and is responsible for keeping a global AD infrastructure online and running optimally. Mike is also a regular PowerShell community blogger and speaker at the this year's PowerShell summit in Seattle, Washington.

Mike wanted to fill in the gaps that his monitoring tools weren't able to cover, so he started to write his own toolset to help keep an eye on some of the core components of Active Directory. This talk is designed to show how anyone can use simple scripts to make their own customized monitoring platform.

This is a local meeting that will be held at the MetLife campus in Cary but we'll also have a virtual meeting option for people who can't attend in person. The meeting starts at 6:30 pm and the presentation will start at 7 pm. The first half hour is for members to socialize, eat and cover any announcements that are related to our group. The link for this meeting will be posted the day of the meeting to people who have RSVP'ed yes to this event.
