Join Thomas Nieto as he introduces his module, AnyPackage! With this powerful tool, you can easily install software packages from popular repositories using just one set of cmdlets.

## Meeting Overview:

In recent years, the conversation around installing software from package repositories has really heated up. Some users are die-hard fans of Chocolatey, others swear by WinGet, and many have their own secret weapon with Scoop. But letâ€™s be honestâ€”juggling the different syntaxes for each of these tools can feel like solving a puzzle with missing pieces.

Thatâ€™s where AnyPackage comes in! Created by the talented Thomas Nieto, this outstanding module lets you install software from multiple repositories (and beyond) using a unified set of cmdlets.

Join us as Thomas takes us on a journey through the magic of AnyPackage, demonstrating how it works. Afterwards Thomas will peel back the cover of the module and highlight some of the clever code he crafted to overcome unique challenges in its design. Get ready for a session that promises to simplify your software installation experience!
