PowerShell is such a capable and versatile tool that the advice we sometimes hear is to replace the question "Can you use PowerShell to do that?" with "Should you use PowerShell to do that?".

Join Lucas Allman as he explains how he ignored that advice completely and built a Configuration as Code (CaC) toolset in PowerShell for managing his team's device management and reporting automations.

<!--more-->

## Meeting Overview:

Lucas will demo his home-grown toolset which includes custom PowerShell modules for maintaining the environment, the Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretManagement module for managing automation credentials, GitHub for versioning and collaboration and good old Window Task Scheduler.  More than just the sum of it's parts, Lucas will also talk about why a sane person would chose to build your their toolset instead of using a pre-built solution, and how you and your team could benefit from the journey.

## What Can You Expect?

By the end of the session, you'll have an idea of how a CaC framework can help your team manage their automations, what considerations are necessary for success, and what other, possibly more sane options are available to you.
Most of all, Lucas wants to encourage you to build that solution you've been thinking about.

- Even if it's not perfect.
- Even if it's been done before.
- Even if PowerShell maybe isn't the "right" tool for the job.

Because sometimes the "right" tool for the job is the one your team already knows how to use.
