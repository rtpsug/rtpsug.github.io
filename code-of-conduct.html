            <h3>Research Triangle PowerShell User Group Code of Conduct</h3>

            <p class="">Welcome to the Research Triangle PowerShell User Group (RTPSUG)! We are committed to fostering a positive and inclusive
            community for PowerShell enthusiasts to learn and share their knowledge. To ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for
            everyone, we have established the following code of conduct:</p>

            <p class=""><b>1. Respectful Behavior:</b> Treat all members with respect and courtesy. We welcome diversity and value different
            perspectives.</p>

            <p class=""><b>2. Inclusive Environment:</b> Foster an inclusive environment where everyone feels welcome, regardless of their background,
            experience level, or identity.</p>

            <p class=""><b>3. Collaboration:</b> Encourage collaboration and knowledge-sharing. We are here to learn from each other and grow together.</p>

            <p class=""><b>4. No Harassment:</b> Harassment of any kind, including but not limited to unwelcome comments, offensive language, or
            disruptive behavior, will not be tolerated.</p>

            <p class=""><b>5. Code of Conduct Enforcement:</b> The group leaders reserve the right to remove anyone who engages in behavior that
            disrupts the positive and collaborative atmosphere of the group.</p>

            a community where everyone can learn and thrive together.</p>
